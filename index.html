        <p>Hello! Welcome to my website, this is Kristy. I am in the Software Developer program at Fox Valley Technical College. Before joining the program, 
        I have had no computer programming experience, but I've learned so much on this journey and am excited to continue growing in this field. 
        I have worked in healthcare for a very long time and am now currently working in the banking industry. During my free time, I enjoy traveling, 
        spending time with friends and family, cooking, camping, and hiking. My favorite foods include sushi, eggrolls, and pizza! Places that I would 
        love to travel to in the future are Japan, South Korea, and Thailand. If I could have one superpower, it would be teleportation so 
        I could travel to all my favorite destinations faster! </p>
